# Scattered Verses
This game is an attempt to create a Love2d RPG with custom made shaders. 

## Tasklist
- [x] Create topdown jump system for player
- [x] Create topdown platform system for z-index
- [x] Create shadow casting algorithm using GLSL 
- [ ] Create x, y, and z collision detection system
- [ ] Create light casting algorithm using GLSL
- [ ] Create day to night system
- [ ] Create water virtual screen to render over rest of the map
- [ ] Create mask system for player so he can swim
- [ ] Create hacky lighting and shadowing system
- [ ] Add water considerations for color map (perhaps in pixel.r; since pixel.g could accommodate both pixel.g and pixel.r info currently). Height map could be created dynamically.
